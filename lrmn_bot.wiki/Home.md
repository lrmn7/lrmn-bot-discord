# The reason behind this project

The reason behind this project is simple, I was tired of seeing freeware bots offering limited features, and that paid features had always been features that made me want, so I decided to develop this open-source and accessible bot to all in different ways, indeed different choices are available to you in order to use this discord bot !

## What I am and what i actually do

Access a database to store server settings.
- Fully personalized welcome message with predefined image. (ðŸš§ allow to change the image by everyone)
- Possibility of currently having 4 different leave messages, these 4 messages are sent randomly! (ðŸš§ on being able to admit an "infinity")
- Possibility to activate/set up Youtube and/or Twitch notifications (ðŸš§ on the fact of being able to admit an "infinity" of Youtube/Twitch notifications)
- Classic moderation command, namely: /ban; /kick ; /free time ; /clear
- Various command type tools such as:
  - dbset => Allows you to configure ALL server settings (welcome messages, etc.)
  - talkasbot => For lovers to make sure members don't know it's you behind ðŸ™‚
  - and others ðŸ™‚
- Use of slashCommands still not implemented by mee6 and many bots on the market

The main concern right now is:
Having only a few discord servers with my homemade bot, unfortunately the latter has limitations imposed by the discord bot verification certification, but this is not a particular concern at the moment.
